You might think it is quite tricky to learn formal languages, but it is actually not! You already know one: mathematics, which in fact written largely the same way in Python as you would write it by hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Speaking Python\n",
    "To communicate with the computer via Python, we first need to open the Python interpreter. This will *interpret* our typed commands into machine language so that the computer can understand it. On Windows open the `Anaconda Prompt`, on MacOS open `terminal.app`, and on Linux open whichever terminal you prefer (e.g. `gnome-terminal` or `konsole`). Then type in `python` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You should see something like this:\n",

    ">>> \n",
    "```\n",

This is another strength of using Python for data analysis, some programming languages requires an additional step where the typed instructions are compiled into machine language and saved as a separate file that they computer can run. Although compiling code often results in faster execution time, Python allows us to very quickly experiment and test new code, which is where most of the time is spent when doing exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sparseness in the input 4 + 5 is much more efficient than typing \"Hello computer, could you please add 4 and 5 for me?\". Formal computer languages also avoid the ambiguity present in natural languages such as English. You can think of Python as a combination of math and a formal, succinct version of English. Since it is designed to reduce ambiguity, Python lacks the edge cases and special rules that can make English so difficult to learn, and there is almost always a logical reason for how the Python language is designed, not only a historical one.\n",

    "## Jupyter Lab and the Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the Python interpreter is very powerful, it is commonly bundled with other useful tools in interfaces specifically designed for exploratory data analysis. One such interface is JupyterLab from Project Jupyter, which is what we will be using today. JupyterLab originates from a project called IPython, an effort to make Python development more interactive. Since its inception, the scope of the project expanded to include additional programming languages, such as Julia and R, so the name was changed to \"Jupyter\" (JU-PY-te-R) as a reference to its core languages. Here, we will be using the Jupyter notebook within JupyterLab, which allows us to easily take notes about our analysis and view plots within the same document where we code. The notebook format also facilitates sharing of analyses, since the notebook interface is easily accessible through any web browser as well as exportable as a PDF or HTML page.\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLab is launched by running `juptyer lab` from the terminal, or by finding it in the `Anaconda navigator` from your operating system menu. This should output some text in the terminal and open new tab in your default browser. Although a web browser is used to display the JupyterLab interface, you don't need to be connected to the internet to use it. All the files necessary to run JupyterLab are stored locally and the browser is simply used to display the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the new browser tab, click the plus sign to the left and select to create a new notebook in the Python language (also `File --> New --> Notebook`). A new notebook has no name other than \"Untitled\". If you click on \"Untitled\" you will be given the option of changing the name to whatever you want. The notebook is divided into cells. Initially there will be a single input cell. You can type Python code directly into the cell, just as we did before. To run the output, press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> or click the play button in the toolbar."

    "The little counter on the left of each cell keeps track of in which order the cells were executed, and changing to an `*` when the computer is processing the computation (only noticeable for computation that takes longer time). If the `*` is shown for a really long time, the Python kernel might have frozen and needs to be restarted, which can be done via the circular arrow button in the toolbar.The kernel is the server that enables Python programmers to run cells within Notebook. You typically see the kernel commands in the terminal window.\n",

    "The notebook is saved automatically, but it can also be done manually from the toolbar or by hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>. Both the input and the output cells are saved so any plots that you make will be present in the notebook next time you open it up without the need to rerun any code. This allows you to create complete documents with both your code and the output of the code in a single place instead of spread across text files for your codes and separate image files for each of your graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook itself is stored as a JSON file with an .ipynb extension. These are specially formatted text files, which can be exported and imported into another Jupyter system. This allows you to share your code, results, and documentation with others. You can also export the notebook to HTML, PDF, and many other formats to make sharing even easier! This is done via `File --> Export Notebook As...` \n",
    "(The first time trying to export to PDF, there might be an error message with instructions on how to install TeX. Follow those instructions and try exporting again. If it is still not working, click Help --> Launch Classic Notebook and try exporting the same way as before).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to open up other document types in JupyterLab, e.g. text documents and terminals. These can be placed side by side with the notebook through drag and drop, and all running programs can be viewed in the \"Running\" tab to the left. To search among all available commands for the notebook, the \"Commands\" tab can be used. Existing documents can be opened from the \"File Browser\" tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very useful tool in Jupyter lab is the **Contextual Help** tab you can find under \"Commands\" tab. You can drag it next to your editor looks up the docs for whatever function your cursor is on and shows you the function signature of the command as you type it."

We can see that to use this function, we need to supply it with the argument a, which should be 'array-like'. An array is essentially just a sequence of numbers. We just saw that one way of doing this was to enclose numbers in brackets [], which in Python means that these numbers are in a list, something you will hear more about later. Instead of manually activating the menu every time, the JupyterLab offers a tool called the \"Inspector\" which displays help information automatically. I find this very useful and always have it open next to my Notebook. More help is available via the \"Help\" menu, which links to useful online resources (for example Help --> Numpy Reference)."
