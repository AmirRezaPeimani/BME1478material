# BME1478H Final Assignment

Worth 28% of final grade. 

Timeline: 
Part 1: Propose hypothesis to test relevant to assigned group topic
 - March 25th, 11:59pm

Instructions: 

1. Download/set-up folder structure for assignment
2. Based on the assigned question, explore the data for possible relationships between indicators relevant to your group's topic. 
3. End product - a jupyter notebook (and an exported PDF) that makes use of both Markdown and Code cells to explain the code, visualizations and data/statisical analyses you are performing on your group's assigned topic. 
    1. Come up with a short title describing the results of your analysis on the group topic
    2. "Introduction" section (150 words max) briefly stating your hypothesis and what you will be exploring in your notebook.
    3. Include 4 (minimum) separate plots/figures relevant to group's topic. 
        - Above each plot/figure should be a markdown cell explaining in plain English with:
            - What you are trying to visualize? (i.e what do the axes mean)
            - What is the rationale behind why you chose the type of plot/graph and the variables to plot?
            - What is your interpretation of the results shown in the plot as it relates to your group's topic?
        - A facetgrid/plot/pairplot counts as 1 plot
    4. Include 1 (minimum) statistical test of your hypothesis submitted in Part 2. We are not marking you for proving your hypothesis i.e. you could get a null/negative result and will still get full marks so long as you correctly implemented the statistical test in Python.
4. When you are completed the assignment, upload your group's directory of final results to the GitHub repo we've created for you. All members must add one line to the README.md stating:
    1. Name
    2. Name one thing you learned in this class (e.g. how to clean NA values from a dataframe, how to perform a t-test in Python, how to plot using matplotlib etc., please be respectful in these responses)
    - each person must have submitted their own commit with this information (someone else cannot commit on their account for you)
